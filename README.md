# Node Web Server Demos

This is a collection of simple Node web server demos (note these are web _servers_, not _frameworks_ such as Sails and LoopBack).

## Rules

For each web server, we'll build 3 examples:

1. Hello World
2. Mock REST API
3. Cookie-based Authentication

For each additional example you add (or for each example you modify), try to match the folder structure and behavior of the existing examples. Each framework should also have a README that uses the Mei System (see the current READMEs) to weigh pros and cons of the library.

## Current Examples

- Express
- Hapi
- Horizon (no server) - this example doesn't follow the rules, since there isn't actually any backend code to write!

## Welcome Examples

We'd also love examples of the following libraries, so if you're familiar with them, please contribute!

- Restify (I believe Erik may work on this)
- Koa
